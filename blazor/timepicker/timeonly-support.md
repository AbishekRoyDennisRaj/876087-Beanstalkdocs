# TimeOnly Support in Blazor TimePicker Component

The [TimeOnly](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.dateonly?view=net-7.0) type in .NET 7 is a new property of the System.DateTime type that can be used to store a Time value without the date component.

We can use the "TimeOnly" type in Syncfusion Blazor TimePicker component in .NET 7.0 version.

The following example demonstrates the TimePicker component with TimeOnly type.

{% include_relative code-snippet/TimeOnly.razor %}

{% endhighlight %}
