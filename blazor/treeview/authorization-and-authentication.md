# Authorization and Authentication in Blazor TreeView Component

**Authentication** verifies the identity of a user or system using credentials such as a username and password, biometric data, or security tokens. 

**Authorization** determines a user's access to resources or actions based on their verified identity and set rules or policies.

The Blazor TreeView component provides a sample implementation of Authorization and Authentication. This ensures that only authorized users can access the resources and information within the TreeView, providing better security and privacy for the system. The below blob also includes steps to create a Blazor Server app with Authentication, ensuring easy setup and configuration.
