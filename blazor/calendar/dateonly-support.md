# DateOnly Support in Blazor Calendar Component

The [DateOnly](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.dateonly?view=net-7.0) type in .NET 7 is a new property of the System.DateTime type that can be used to store a date value without the time component.

We can use the "DateOnly" type in Syncfusion Blazor Calendar component in .NET 7.0 version.

The following example demonstrates the Calendar component with DateOnly type.

{% highlight Razor %}

{% include_relative code-snippet/DateOnly.razor %}

{% endhighlight %}
