# System requirements for Blazor Components

System requirements are the required specifications a device must have in order to use certain hardware or software. To get started with the Syncfusion Blazor application, we need to ensure the following software to be installed in the machine.

## Integrated Development Environment

You can develop the Syncfusion Blazor Components by using any one of the following IDE's.

* [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)

  Visual Studio is a feature-rich, versatile, and free IDE for developing modern apps for Android, iOS, Windows, as well as web apps and cloud services.

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

  Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.
  
* [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)

  JetBrains Rider differs from Visual Studio, which also offers a community edition, of course, lacking several features of its enterprise counterpart.Rider originates from other JetBrains such as ReSharper and WebStorm but now turned into an IDE.Rider from JetBrains only has a paid version, not a free one.Howeever it improves the build time drastically as compared to Visual Studio by applying heuristics to only build the projects that need to be updated. For large solutions, it is a real performance booster.

## Framework & SDK

To use Syncfusion Blazor components you must have one of the following frameworks installed on your machine.

* [.NET Core SDK 3.1.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) 
* [.NET 5.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
* The latest [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) version with the ASP.NET and Web development workload.
