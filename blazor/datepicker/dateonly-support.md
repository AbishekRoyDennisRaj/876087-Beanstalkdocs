# DateOnly Support in Blazor DatePicker Component

The [DateOnly](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.dateonly?view=net-7.0) type in .NET 7 is a new property of the System.DateTime type that can be used to store a date value without the time component.

We can use the "DateOnly" type in Syncfusion Blazor DatePicker component in .NET 7.0 version.

The following example demonstrates the DatePicker component with DateOnly type.

{% highlight Razor %}

{% include_relative code-snippet/DateOnly.razor %}

{% endhighlight %}
